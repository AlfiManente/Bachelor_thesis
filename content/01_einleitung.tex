\chapter{Introduction}


The Standard Model (SM) is the most recent theory, that describes elementary particles and their interactions. 
Many of its predictions, like the Higgs Boson, or the top quark were verified in particle accelerator experiments over the last decade. 
But some phenomena, like dark matter and energy, neutrino oscillations or the antimattter-matter disbalance in the universe are yet to be explained.

The top quark may have potential in determining physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
As the heaviest fermion with a mass of about \SI{172.5}{\GeV}, it has the strongest coupling with the Higgs Field and acts as a potential probe for electroweak symmetry breaking. 
At the ATLAS experiment of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the dominant top quark production occurs through
